# Python for Data Analysts

## Project Overview
This repository is designed for **beginners** who want to learn **Python for Data Analysis** from the ground up. Unlike traditional data analysis tutorials that heavily rely on **pandas** and **NumPy**, this course emphasizes **pure Python** for data manipulation and analysis, with minimal use of NumPy (only for generating arrays in a few cases).

This project is part of DataClax **Data Analytics Module** but is open-source, making it accessible to anyone eager to learn Python for data analytics. Inspired by "[Python Crash Course](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280)"—by Eric Matthes, a book that helped me overcome my fear of programming —I created this repository to simplify the learning process and help others overcome their fear of programming, just as I did.

## What You'll Learn
This repository covers fundamental Python concepts essential for **data analysts**, including:
- **Variables and Data Types**
- **Data Structures** (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets)
- **Functions and Classes**
- **Modules, libraries and Packages**
- **Basic Data Analysis** (without pandas)
- **Data Visualization** (with Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly)
- **Regular Expressions** (Regex)
  

## Why This Project?
Many beginners struggle with Python when starting their data analytics journey. This repository attempts to provide a **simple, beginner-friendly** approach to learning Python **before diving into libraries like pandas, NumPy, or SQL**. By focusing on pure Python first, learners build a **solid foundation** that makes transitioning to advanced tools much easier.


## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/peterobarotu/Python_for_Data_Analysts.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd Python_for_Data_Analysts
   ```
3. Run the lessons in Jupyter Notebook.

## Open Source & Contribution
This project is **open-source** as a way of giving back to the community. Everyone is welcome to contribute, suggest improvements, or use it as a stepping stone to their Python journey.
