    "Let's bring all the components together to create a comprehensive simulation of a sniper's world. We'll start by defining a `SniperRifle` object that represents the weapon the sniper uses. Next, we'll create a `Skills` instance to represent the sniper's skillset, encompassing various attributes like confirmed kills, accuracy, combat experience, and more. With these foundational pieces in place, we'll create a `Sniper` object, giving them a name, rank, serial number, the previously defined rifle, and the skills they possess.\n",

Each mission will have its unique attributes, such as name, location, objectives, number of targets, estimated target ranges, and external ballistics factors. We'll associate a Sniper with a mission, providing them the opportunity to engage targets, taking into account external factors like wind, gravity, and distance.\n",
