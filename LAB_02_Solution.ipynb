These ratios will simulate the wear and tear the rifle experiences over time due to usage. For example, if the accuracy was 70% (0.7) and we **assumed** that the first value generated in the array above is 0.1197 or ~ 12% and it is the percentage of damage to the accuracy, we'll subtract 0.7 * 0.12 from the initial accuracy to get the new value for accuracy as follows:\n",

Imagine you have a variety of numbers that represent different qualities of a sniper rifle, like accuracy, muzzle velocity, caliber, and suppressor power. These numbers are in different ranges - some between 0 and 100, others between 700 and 950, and so on.\n",

    "Think of it as a tool that helps you change these numbers to a common scale. We're using a type of normalization called \"Min-Max Normalization\". This method takes a number, like accuracy, and transforms it into a smaller number between 0 and 1. This way, no matter how large or small the original numbers were, they're all rescaled to fit nicely between 0 and 1.\n",

The `missions` attribute within the `Skill` class should be augmented by 1 after each mission, effectively representing the count of missions the sniper has participated in. This provides a quantifiable measure of the sniper's mission experience. Additionally, the remaining skills should see improvements based on a predetermined development factor, highlighting the sniper's progression in various aspects."

Next, we'll create a `Skills` instance to represent the sniper's skillset, encompassing various attributes like confirmed kills, accuracy, combat experience, and more. With these foundational pieces in place, we'll create a `Sniper` object, giving them a name, rank, serial number, the previously defined rifle, and the skills they possess.\n",

    "With our `Sniper` ready, we'll move on to creating missions. Each mission will have its unique attributes, such as name, location, objectives, number of targets, estimated target ranges, and external ballistics factors. We'll associate a Sniper with a mission, providing them the opportunity to engage targets, taking into account external factors like wind, gravity, and distance.\n",
